--------------------

SokoMind is a Sokoban game where you have to
move boxes across corridors into target squares.
You can only push one single box at a time, and
you are not able to pull boxes, so you have to
take care not to block your way.

5. New in version 3.4:
----------------------

-New: Language support for Spanish
 (menus, dialogs and pop-up help texts)
 Thanks to Juan Carlos Uriarte 
 <roblesolido@hotmail.com> for the translation
-New: Bookmarks - Set up to 99 bookmarks when you 
 play a level, go back to a previous position without 
 much effort
-New: When a level is solved for the very first time,
 the time that was necessary is now stored within 
 the solution file. The game can be paused by pressing
 F2. This time value is displayed within the Info 
 dialog along with other statistical data (CTRL-i).
-New: Transparent floors

6. New in version 3.3:
----------------------

(Please note that there is no updated help file yet that
describes the new features more detailled.)

-New: Improved mouse operation (Click on the box wich you
 want to move, then click to the place where it should be
 moved to; if the move is possible, it will be performed
 automatically. The algorithm does not always find the
 shortest way but it works, in most cases well enough. If
 you want the load to be pushed along a specific path,
 you can accomplish this by running in straight
 segments.)
-New: Advance to next unsolved level
-New: Play same level again immediately after solving it
-New: Save solution of levels that were imported from
 clipboard or do not exist as a file for any other reason
-New: Toolbar
-New: Compare high scores of different players for each level
-New: In the load dialog, you can set a favorite folder for
 SokoMind levels (right click to a free spot within the 
 dialog box)
-Changed: "Next level" and "previous level" now simply
 step through all level files within an external folder
 in alphabetical order; it is not longer required that
 the left part of .XSB file names follows a specific syntax
-Changed: "Go to level..." no longer returns to built-in
 levels when called while playing an external level
 but shows the "load level" dialog in order to allow
 selection of another external level
-Fixed: If a level has a title, now the title is displayed
 instead of the file name
-Fixed: External levels in UNIX style files
 (LF instead of CR/LF) are now opened correctly
-Many small bug fixes

-Please note that position files (.XBP) saved with
 version 3.0 or earlier are not compatible
 and cannot be read.
